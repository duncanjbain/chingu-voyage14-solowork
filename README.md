# Chingu Voyage 14 - Solo Pre-Work
This is my submission for the pre-work part of [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) Voyage 14. The project is the [Tier 1 solo project](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/voyage-prework-tier1-favfonts), which is to create a basic "clone" of the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) webpage.

The structure and styling should be similar, but it will have limited functionality.

## Submission
The submission can be viewed [here](https://duncanjbain.github.io/chingu-voyage14-solowork/). This is currently hosted using GitHub pages.

## Requirements
The submission meets all mandatory requirements, but does meet any of the optional requirements currently. This will be a work in progress, but due to time constraints with the submission deadline, this is very much a minimum viable product!

## Dependencies
This website is created using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript so therefore has very little in the way of depencies.

What dependencies have been used, can be seen below.
